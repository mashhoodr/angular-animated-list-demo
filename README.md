# Angular Animated List Demo

This is a very simple project to demo the basics of Angular animations module. There are two branches with a simple and advanced solution to animating a list. Use for my talk at International Javascript Conference 2018 Munich.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Solutions

Solutions are configured in `simple-animation` branch and `advanced-animation` branch respectively.
